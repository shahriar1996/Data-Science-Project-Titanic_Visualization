## Summary of the project
This is one of my projects from Data Visualization course. The titanic dataset contains different variables of passengers such as class type, gender, fare amount, cabin & ticket number, age, etc., and the independent variable of the dataset is survival rate. Survival variable is a numeric field in the dataset, and it contains 0 and 1. 0 indicates that the passenger didn't survive and 1 indicates the passenger was survived. The center focus for this visualization project is to create graphs and do some basic mathematics to get an idea if different variables can affect the survival rate directly or not.
